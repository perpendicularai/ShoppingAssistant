## 🧃 Project Motivation

Looking for the price of an item can be a tedious task. Often has it been that I need to find the price of a grocery item. 
Having to look on my mobile device proved to be somewhat laborious. I then resorted to putting together this project which aims to alleviate the chore of looking for grocery prices.
